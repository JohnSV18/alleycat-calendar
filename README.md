# Alleycat Calendar

Welcome to the Alleycat Calender!

Although alleycats are unsanctioned races for bikes (normally for fixie/track bikes), we still want to have some organization and be able to keep track of races that you or others have raced in. With alleycat races being made at different times by different groups in different locations, there isn't one single place where one can see what races had already passed or which are coming up. This is where we come in as the online calendar of the Alleycat Races.

In the future, we hope to add to the organization by allowing people to filter through the races by year, location, etc.
